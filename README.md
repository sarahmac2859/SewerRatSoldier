# SewerRatSoldier
Final repository (hopefully!) for first shmup remix


For my first shmup, I want to make a game called Sewer Rat Cowboy. In the brainstorming phase, Aidan and I were throwing words around and came up with this phrase, which I thought was really interesting and could make for a unique game. I think it'd be fun to have a shooter character that moves around in a sewer system, and as he runs around he's attacked by rats. They could come from the pipes from different directions off the screen and that would be really fun to interact with. If I could figure out how to flood the area that would be pretty cool too, like if there's a random chance a pipe might burst or something. I want it to kind of look like a platformer and be pixelated, so it kind of has an old school look to it.
